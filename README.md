As part of the project, I conduct an EDA of the credit data of clients of a certain bank, pre-process the data and train several models and ensemble methods to classify clients who have loan arrears for more than 90 days. A more detailed description is provided in the notebooks/debtors-classification.ipynb file.  
When writing the project, I decided that there was no need to visualize the data and results, and I presented all the interesting patterns and metrics for each model in the form of visual dataframes. I have tried to describe the conclusions and patterns identified during the research in detail in the file.
